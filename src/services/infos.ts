    <p>Are you wondering <i>"Why do I have to have strong secret, when generated password is super-strong anyway?"</i></p>
                    <p>Good question! And the answer is simple - it significantly reduces effectiveness of possible brute-force attacks.</p>
                    <p>Imagine someone, let's call him Mr. Attacker, who wants to hack your accounts. Mr. Attackers goal is to find your secret.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Attacker was able to acquire one
                        of your generated passwords via <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank">phishing site</a>. 
                        and thanks to <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)" target="_blank">social engineering</a>,
                        he was able to figure out, that you use hash function to generate passwords based on your secret.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, with one of your passwords Mr. Attacker can start generating random texts, over which he will apply your hash function, with hopes,
                    that one of these texts will match the stolen password. Thus finding out the original secret at random - just by using many trial-and-error runs.</p>
                    <p>Let's do some napkin math.</p>
                    <p>We assume, that Mr. Attacker has access to a supercomputer, which can test 1 000 000 000 000 hash generations per second</p>
                    <p>If your secret is weak, with this many trial-and-errors, it would be cracked in seconds.</p>
                    <p>However, if your secret is long, unique, unpredictable with all kinds of symbols,
                    this would represent ~1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 possibilities, he would need to test against.</p>
                    <p>Put otherwise, it would take Mr. Attacker and his supercomputer trillions upon trillions of years to find the match.</p>

    <h2>How GetMeKey Works</h2>
    <p>GetMeKey is tool, that allows you to have safe and unique passwords for all your applications, only by providing it with your
    secret text and name of the desired application. This is achieved by putting these two pieces of information togather and running it through
    cryptographic <a href="/what-is-hash">hash function</a>. All steps are described in-depth <a href="/generation-steps">here</a>.</p>   
    <p>Using this approach you can quickly recreate your passwords on demand, on any device, even when offline. And if some compromised app leaks
    your password, it doesn't impact any other account that you have.</p>    
    <h2>Story Of GetMeKey</h2>
    <p><i>GetMeKey</i> is successor of a personal tool, that I created for my own needs.</p>
    <p>After years of trying to find the best way how to manage hundrets of passwords and testing dozens of solutions along the way, 
    I came up with and idea, that ticked all the boxes. Idea that would be based on mixing single secret text with app name and hashing algorithm.</p>
    <p>This idea:</p>        
    <ul>
      <li>Creates unbreakable passwords</li>  
      <li>Relies on remembering as few datapoints as possible</li>      
      <li>Desn't depend on any specific service</li>      
      <li>Could not be hacked or stealed</li>
      <li>Could quickly provide needed password anywhere, on any device, even when offline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unfortunatelly, no service or implementation of this idea existed.</p>
    <p>Luckly, being an IT engineer, who developed secured, mission-critical systems for multiple international companies for more than a decade,
     gave me more than enough experience, to put first version togather in few hours.</p>
    <p>This demo app, with very original working title <i>"PasswordGenerator"</i> was very simple and ugly looking - yet worked perfectly!</p>
    <p>As years went by, and I was adding more bells and whistles to it, I started to notice that password management is still open topic,
    even though many other applications exist already.</p>
    <p>Many people I talked to, found same flaws with these applications, as I did.</p>
    <p>That's when I decided to make <i>PasswordGenerator</i> open to everyone. After some tweeks and updates <i>GetMeKey</i> was born.</p>
    <h2>Afterword</h2>
    <p>I certainly hope you will find GetMeKey useful. If so, please let me know - any feedback, good or bad, is always appreciated!</p>
    <p>Have fun and - <b>be safe!</b></p>

    <p>Marking secret as recalled has several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Next time you enter your secret, you see that this secret has been entered before, letting you know you didn't do any typo</li>
        <li>Your <a href="/hash-settings">Hash Settings</a> are encrypted and stored together with secret hash, so you don't have to specify them every time</li>
        <li>Enables to use <strong>Remember Recalled Secret</strong> option</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When secret is marked as <strong>Recalled</strong>, it is not the secret that's stored on the device, but its hashed value.</p>
    <p>This means, even if someone with full access to your device and knowledge of GetMeKey, could not reveal your secret.</p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Every time you type something into the <strong>Secret</strong> field, GetMeKey calculates its hash value and compares it with all hash values of previous secrets marked as <strong>Recalled</strong>.
    If there is match of hashes, GetMeKey knows it has been marked as <strong>Recalled</strong> before.</p>
    <p>Then it can decrypt <a href="/hash-settings">Hash Settings</a>, that were stored together with hashed secret, in encrypted form, using the secret as a key.</p>
    <h2>Remember Recalled Secret</h2>
    <p>If you leave GetMeKey, while recalled secret is active, this secret will be remembered and prefilled next time you open GetMeKey.</p>
    <p>As security measure, an attempt to reveal the secret after the reload, will cause secret to be discarded.</p>

    <p>To prevent typos and app-naming-conundrums, only lowercase letters and " - " are allowed, as any minor modification of this value would result in totally different password. E.g. "netflix" and "Netflix" would be seen as different applications.</p>
    <p>We recommend to use the main domain name as an app name.</p>
    <p>E.g. https://mail.<strong>google</strong>.com can be used as "<strong>google</strong>".</p>

        <p>PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) enhances security by using a salt to prevent rainbow table 
        attacks and applying a pseudorandom function like HMAC (using SHA in the process) multiple times to the password and salt to increase 
        computational effort, thwarting brute-force attacks.</p>
        <p>This algorithm is selected as default for GetMeKey, due to its iterative properties and being implemented directly in the browser.</p>
        <p>Number of iterations is adjustable and defaults to 1 000 000 - offering the best ratio of security and speed.</p>        
        <h2><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms" target="_blank">SHA</a></h2>
        <p>SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed to provide a fixed-size 
        hash value from variable-length input data, ensuring data integrity. SHA is fast and efficient, which also 
        makes it more prone to be cracked with brute-force attack.</p>
        <p>SHA doesn't provide in-built salting mechanism. GetMeKey can achieve this effect, by (pre/su)fixing the secret
        with <string>App Name</string> value.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt" target="_blank">Scrypt</a></h2>
        <p>Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function designed to make it costly both in terms of time and 
        memory to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks. It achieves this by using a large amount of memory 
        compared to other key derivation functions like PBKDF2. It allows for the tuning of memory usage, 
        processing time, and parallelism to adapt to different security requirements.</p>

    <h2>Password Text Encoding</h2>
    <p>Used hash functions are binary based, which means that the hashing is done by first transforming the text to its binary form and
    then applying binary transformations.</p>
    <p>The result is also binary - just long list of pseudo-randomly ordered 1s and 0s.</p>
    <p>To transform this into the text password, we can use <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Base62" target="_blank">Base62</a> encoding algorithm.
    Base 62 generates text using only letters and numbers and no special characters.</p>
    <h2>Take First Characters</h2>
    <p>Resulting text can be very long - not really suitable for password yet. So GetMeKey takes only first X characters.
    20 by default, but can be adjusted.</p>
    <h2>Security Prefix</h2>
    <p>Lastly, this password doesn't contain any special character and could be generated, by chance, without any uppercase, lowercase or number characters.</p>
    <p>It's common password requirement to have these conditions met. Therefore, GetMeKey prefixes the password with constant text - " <i>Ab1!</i> " by default.</p>
